# Javascript-challenge

### Overview:
`ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports of ufo sightings. That dataset is then used to create a webpage with data getting displayed dynamically.

### Technologies used:
>> Javascript <br>
>> HTML<br>
>> CSS<br>
>> D3.js<br>

#### Level:1 (Automatic Table and Date Search)
> - The UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects is used to add table to the web page.<br>
> - The table has the following columns: `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, `duration` and `comment`.<br>
> - Javascript code is written to listen for event and search through the table for the provided `data/time`.<br>
> - The filtered data is then rendered back to the web page.<br>

#### Level:2 (Multiple Search Categories)
> - The columns: `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape` are considered as filter criteria and javascript code is written to filter the dataset on various combinations.<br>
> - I have used drop down select for `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape` and inout text for `date/time`.
